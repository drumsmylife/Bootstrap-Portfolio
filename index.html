        <p>My name is Tommy Cervenka. I am 25 years old and I live in North Riverside, IL. I went to Loras College in Dubuque, IA. I graduated with a bachelors in Social Work.</p>
        <p>I am currently employed at Soaring Eagle Academy in Lombard, IL. Soaring Eagle Academy is a school for children with Autism. I am a Blue responder/Music program assistant. A blue responder is someone who ensures that the children are safe when they are dysregulated or are having a hard time calming themselves down. I help keep the children/staff safe when one of these situations occurs. My role as a music program assistant is teaching drum lessons to students who are capable.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and have gained skills to become a full stack javascript developer. I have become familar with HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, API/AJAX, Reactjs, Nodejs, mySQL, Firebase, and plenty more. I am still continuing to expand my coding skills and learn new programming languages.</p>
        <p>I want to change career paths and become a web developer. My dad is a computer programmer and I have seen some of the things he does and I was amazed by it. He created a few Apps and I saw all the stuff that goes into it. I decided that I want to do the same as him and push myself to learn how to code. Being able to create Apps/websites and actually have them work has been very rewarding to me.</p>
